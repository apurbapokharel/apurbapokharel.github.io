## My personal philosophy on Life

Best explained through the mantras I follow:

```
"The meaning of life is what is revealed to you when you take the path of maximum responsibility" - Dr. Jordan Peterson.
```
```
"Do hard things" - Steve Magness. 
```
```
"You can always do more" - Jocko Willink.
```

## Hobbies?

As of now, computers and exercising are my hobbies. I am either working in the lab and doing R&D, or I am at home learning, building things that interest me, or I am somewhere sweating. Recently, I've been working on miniature versions of real-world problems, and so far I've built Grep and BitTorrent. Why did I do this? Read about that [here](https://github.com/apurbapokharel/codecrafters-grep-go?tab=readme-ov-file#intro). I absolutely love Linux and use Arch (BTW), as well as love Rust and use it for most of the system-level programming I do.

Besides these, I rarely have time for anything else right now. My girlfriend is one of the best and brightest things in my life. I exercise and practise discipline like it's my full-time job. I am always training and pushing my limits. In 2025, I finished 2nd for my age group in a 5-mile [race](https://runsignup.com/Race/Results/137375/IndividualResult/BQdN#U102730481). Last week (August 2025), I swam 4200 yards. Some months ago, I ran 20 miles. Some time before that, I ran a sub-6-minute Mile, or did 100+ pullups in 30 minutes......

Exercise to me is how I sharpen my mind so that I can tackle and win in the game of life.

## What do I wanna do with my life?

I came to this country with one dream. It was to contribute and be involved with the frontier of innovations. I want to be able to see this dream through. Besides this, I want to be able to close the distance and be together with my girlfriend forever, as well as take care of my mother.

At the end of my working career, I would like to retire as an open source contributor (best if is is something I built from the ground up) and a guy with a reputation for being able to solve some really tough problems.
