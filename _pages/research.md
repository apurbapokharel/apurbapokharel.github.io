# About my research

## Short Explanation

My research dives into the use of LLMs and how to efficiently use them for solving problems with high agreement (unanimity). My research also explores the integration of autonomous systems into exisiting solutions and frameworks.

## Full Fledge Explanation

My research involves a combination of two major discipline: blockchains and LLMs.

We initially raised the questions "Why is there no true unanimous consensus for blockchains" and "Can we use Blockchains for collaborative problem solving at a consensus level" or in other words can we design a consensus protocol for a distributed ledger system that is based on collaboration and deliberation where the miners come to unanimous consensus. Granted this is a very unorthodox and for some even a blasphemous problem to even attempt to be solving but Dr.Dantu has instilled in me his joy of solving the unsolvable or at least "taking a stab at it" as he puts it so frequently. My 1st paper titled "Deliberaion Leads to Unanamimous Consensus" explores this purely from a theoretical perspective. Buiilding on this, we asked ourself the question based on a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l1RMiGeTfU) we saw a long time ago. "Can we have autonomous agents capable of deliberaiton?", so the result of exploring this question is the work done in my second paper. The proof of concept implementation where we took an open source blockchain (Nimiq) and changed it's consensus protocol and built a deliberation framwork that serves as the new consensus protocol will be made public as soon the paper is accepted for publication.

With this we now ask ourself a new question "This deliberaiton protocol is for definitive deliberation, but what about subjective deliberation?". So we will be *taking a stab at this* for the next work.

# Collaboration at UNT

My lab the Network Security Lab [NSL](https://engineering.unt.edu/cse/research/labs/nsl/index.html) is a lab where we study and propose solutions to next generation of networks. Over the 20 years that NSL has been around it has addresses and proposed novel solutions ranging from next gen 911, to using electromagnetic waves for 3D spatial rendering all the way to blockchains, AI, blockchain for AI, AI for blockchain, quantum computing to now LLMs.
We solve a plethora of problems and are a highly collaborative lab as a result my publications has papers from diverse scopes of computer science ranging from: blockchain, AI, Zero Knowledge Proof, to Metaverse.
