## Philosophy on Teaching

Personally, I consider teaching to be one of the most important jobs in the world. As a teaching assistant, I am not directly involved in teaching, but I try my best to help out the students. The courses assigned are not always the right fit for each individual. When I was a TA for 5575/4575, I considered that to be a perfect match. With my background from working in the blockchain space and the hands-on nature of the course, I was able to help a lot of students solve their coding assignments as well as teach some about the nuances of blockchain. I try my best to help regardless.
