# Open Source Contributions

I am a big supporter and apostle of open source. I am glad I get to have one foot in the field of research and one in the field of engineering and development, where open source is prevalent. I am always open to any open source contribution!

#### Research Contributions

* All my research work is open source. You can find them under the research section.

* Recently, I had the opportunity to contribute as a Technical Program Chair in the IEEE BCCA 2025 conference.

#### Open Source Development

I have been recently trying to get more into open source contributions as well, but that is easier said than done. Here are some of my very few open source contributions I've made in the field of engineering, computer science, and development.

* Back when I worked as a blockchain developer, we were working with new technology and a stack that did not even have proper documentation out yet. To understand them, we had to spend days, if not weeks, reading code and trying to reverse engineer it. During this time, I used to write articles on Medium explaining these innovations.

    - My article on Medium on [ERC 721](https://medium.com/coinmonks/eip712-a-full-stack-example-e12185b03d54) has been viewed 15k people and read by 8k people. 
    - The github repo for [this](https://github.com/apurbapokharel/EIP712Example) has been forked 15 times and starred 35 times.

I do reminisce about these days and see a lot of missed opportunities where I could have contributed more. We were one of the first groups to integrate ERC-1155 into an existing DEX with Vuzec. As well as one of the first teams to integrate the Wormhole message passing protocol on Solana. Due to the fast-moving pace of the work, we missed out on all these possible contributions.

# Talks and Presentation

* In 2025, I appeared in a podcast (it's sadly not in English) where we talked about my experience moving to a new country, what it means to do a PhD, life in America, and many things in between. Linked [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lcJK1qlMSk&pp=ygUPYXB1cmJhIHBva2hhcmVs)

* In 2024, I presented my research work that got accepted into the IEEE BCCA 2024 conference.

* In 2024, I presented my research poster at a conference back in 2024.

* In the past, I've been invited to speak as a panelist in a blockchain (event)[https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bibekblockchain_blockchainfornepal-blockchain-coffee-activity-6943570986210320385-WzD9/]. We talked about how to get into the industry, challenges faced, experiences, advice to new developers, and concluded with a Q&A section.

# Service and Leadership

* In 2025, serving as the secretary for the Nepalese Student Association (NSA) at the University of North Texas.

* In 2022-2023, I was the founder and member of the youth club back home for my community.

* In 2020, I mentored 4 undergraduate students for their capstone projects.

# Technical Blogs

* In the past, I wrote about technical things I did and things that fascinated me in (Medium)[https://medium.com/@apurbapokharel].
